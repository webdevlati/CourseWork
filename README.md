Overview:
This project was done as part of completing my Data Science college course. It focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates strong analytical and programming skills through data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation.

Key Highlights
- Developed using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Built and compared Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models to predict house prices.
- Applied feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques (scaling, encoding, and handling missing values).
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data trends and identify key predictors.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RÂ² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Produced clear, data-driven insights through detailed visualizations and statistical analysis.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Machine Learning (Regression Models)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization
- Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Python Programming

Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
